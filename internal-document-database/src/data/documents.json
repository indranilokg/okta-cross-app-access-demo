Here it is:\n\n---\n\n## Document: Atko Corporation Vacation Policy Changes 2025\n\n### 1. Vacation Accumulation\nEmployees will now accumulate vacation days at a rate of 1.5 days per month of full-time employment, up from 1.25 days.\n\n### 2. Carry-Over\nThe carry-over limit of unused vacation days at year-end increases to 15 days from 10 days. Any days beyond this limit will be forfeited.\n\n### 3. Unscheduled Vacations\nUnscheduled vacation requests may be submitted no less than two weeks in advance and will be granted depending on business needs and the team's coverage.\n\n### 4. Mandatory Time Off\nEach employee will have to take at least five consecutive vacation days annually to ensure they rest and detach from work for wellness.\n\n### 5. Vacation Segment\nVacation time can now be taken in half-day increments to increase flexibility.\n\n### 6. Bereavement Leave\nBereavement leave is now separate from vacation days policy. Specific details can be found in the \"Atko Bereavement Leave Policy\".\n\nPlease note that these changes supersede all prior vacation policies. For more detailed information, please refer to the updated \"Atko Employee Handbook\".\n\n---\n\nShall I save this draft and notify the HR Department for further input and final approval of the \"Atko Corporation Vacation Policy Changes 2025\"?",
